Welcome!
I'm Isabel.
I'm an open source tool builder, keenly interested in making Python an easier and more fun place to do data science work.
Coding is a place for me to be whimsical and creative.
You'll see my doodles all over my website and in the slides of many of my conference talks.

I'd love to chat!
