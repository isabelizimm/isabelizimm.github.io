Here's a non-exhaustive list of talks I have given. I try to highlight talks that I have slides and a recording available to share. Oftentimes my talks include silly doodles to illustrate technical points, which are most of the talk images shown here. This started due to the fact it's really hard to find an image that is *just right* for technical content. Nowadays, the doodles are just a whimsical preparatory step that I enjoy when writing talks.
