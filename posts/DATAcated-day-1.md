# The best of DATAcated day 1

DATAcated is a lightning-talk style conference where each presenter had 10 minutes to evangelize some sort of data topic. Day 1 was based on “Extracting Business Value from Data.” A few takeaways from my top 3 favorite talks today:

## Infonomics: Data is not the new oil

My absolute favorite talk of the day was Doug Laney’s “Data is not the new oil.” A few years back The Economist said that data is the “world’s most valuable resource” and that “data is the new oil.” Doug Laney suggests that this is not the case. Both data and oil can be harvested, integrated, cleansed, stored, processed, and spilled, but their economic characteristics diverge. Data is a non-depleting asset. Using a dataset does not mean the dataset is gone forever while oil is (without a stretch of imagination) less easily reused. Data is a non-rivalrous asset. Data can be used in parallel in multiple ways while a drop of oil can only be used in one location. Data is a propagating asset. Using data well drives the creation of more data while using oil does not create more oil. In short, *data > oil.*

Laney then had some insight on how to stop serially under-leverage your data. “You can’t manage what you don’t measure, and you can’t monetize what you don’t manage.” He mentions that companies have a whole department of people procuring office supplies but 0 people procuring data supplies. It is more difficult to manage data; there’s no balance sheet, no accounting practices. He mentioned a few models to measure the usefulness of data: my hasty notes mention an intrinsic value model, relevancy model, and performance value of information model.

Laney finished up with ideas of how data usage will be monetized in the future. With privacy concerns on the rise, he forecasts that businesses will no longer be selling customer data. Rather, companies that own your data will sell products. This was an interesting business model; Laney used the example of a hospital not being able to sell HIPAA-restricted data. However, hospitals could sell health and wellness tools to patients for a portion of the profit. 


## The hunt for transformational value with AI

Ben Taylor wants AI projects to be transformational, not experiential. A lot of AI projects (Taylor says 75%) fail. Some fail because of lack of technical expertise, but many more fail because people are picking the wrong projects, or picking the wrong focus in the project. Using image recognition to tell the difference between scarves and sweaters is a fun data science project, but lacks a business-value focus. Using image recognition to tell the difference between scarves and sweaters to analyze clickthrough rate for an ecommerce store has transformational value.

How to communicate your AI project to C-suite to make sure it is transformational? There’s a temptation to explain all your technical work. Don’t. There’s a temptation to use “data science” words. Don’t. “If you have to show them one thing, show them a number with a dollar sign.” 

Some other good tips from Ben Taylor were to not complicate things. You probably don’t need deep learning (music to my ears!). Be aware of unintended consequences. Overall, Taylor called people to make sure that there was business value, not just nerd value to data science projects.

## The 8 ‘ates of finding data value

Fully decked out in a hat that boldly says “TRUTH” and an abundance of energy, Scott Taylor says that, “Data is about truth and meaning.” People want data at scale to provide value to relationships and brands. The “truth” is data management. Making sure you have good data is the most critical part of finding value (the “meaning”) from data science. You need truth before meaning; you need data management before data analysis. Truth and meaning is not a chicken and egg problem, but an egg and omelette one. 

The ‘ates: Relate. Every business starts at relationships. Validate. You need some sort of standardized process to ensure you don’t have garbage coming into your data. Integrate. Make sure your data can be standardized and structured. Aggregate. Your data needs to be put in a way that reports and other insights can be made. Interoperate. The machines holding your data need to be able to communicate. Evaluate. Establish your “data truths,” since _good decisions you make on bad data are just bad decisions you don’t know about yet._ Communicate. Your findings must be able to be understood by people other than yourself. Circulate. Evangelize your work!

### Onwards to tomorrow! (literally)
The 10 minute segments and found myself continually engaged, but I did find myself wanting more from some of the talks. Even though there was a lack of deep-dives, almost all of the speakers had linked their blogs, books, or YouTube channels for those who wanted more content. With day 1 down, I’m ready for more data science day 2!
