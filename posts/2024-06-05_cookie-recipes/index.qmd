3.75/5 ‚≠ê. Besides my general annoyance with any recipe that involves a mixer[^1], this is a decent cookie. They're quite sweet and very chewy. The amount of dairy in this cookie is enough that lactose-intolerant people need a warning. I don't think this recipe is worth buying heavy cream and cornstarch, but if you already own these ingredients, no one is going to complain if you whip up a batch of these bad boys.

```
1 cup unsalted butter
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 egg room temp
1 egg yolk, room temp
1 tablespoon heavy cream
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chocolate chips

0. Preheat oven to 350F.
1. Melt butter over stove or in microwave, it will smell fragrant, almost nutty. Put in freezer for 10 mins. 
2. Mix flour, cornstarch, baking soda, salt together in a bowl.
3. Add both sugars in with butter, beat until fluffy (about 2 mins on medium).
4. Stir in eggs, heavy cream, and vanilla.
5. Add dry ingredient mixture,

[^1]: I don't own a stand up mixer. I use a hand mixer that resides in the back corner of a dark cabinet in it's massive original case for "easier storage" even though I can't fit the attachments in the case, so they live in a few different locations, depending on who emptied out the dishwasher. Anyway, the hand mixer is mostly a pain to get out. There's a better organizational system there, but I am so used to my broken workflow that it's almost circled back around to being a good one. That's all to say that I don't really enjoy the cookie recipes that require you to beat sugars and butter until fluffy. This is one of them.
