A "blind date with a book" is where a book gets wrapped up in nondescript paper, and all the intro you get is a vague bullet point or two. You can't judge a book by it's cover, since, well, you can't see it. You have to trust the synopsis and enjoy the adventure.

I got the idea to make a "blind date" with a data science talk after starting to curate a list of my favorite talks for a friend. Unrelated, I have been itching to play around with [the `shinylive` project](https://github.com/quarto-ext/shinylive) to put some interactive things on my blog. Why not put these two together?

Shoutout to Madison Yonash for asking about new data science talks and effectively [nerd sniping](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/356:_Nerd_Sniping) me into spending an evening building this.
