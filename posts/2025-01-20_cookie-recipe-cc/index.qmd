4.5/5 ⭐. This is my own recipe, so I am unashamedly bias. 
I _love_ anything chocolatey.
This lovely because 1) I almost always have all the ingredients on hand and 2) it gives you all the gooey goodness of a brownie in about 15 minutes flat.
The measurements are a bit odd (and I have mismeasured what 2/3c of butter is more times than I'd like to admit).
Despite its funky ratios, it is my go-to.

```
Makes about 10 cookies. 

2/3c butter, softened
1/2 + 1/3c white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup flour
3/4 cup chocolate chips

0. Preheat oven to 350F.
1. Mix butter and sugar until fluffy.
2. Stir in vanilla and egg until combined.
3. Add salt, cocoa powder, baking soda, flour. Stir until combined.
4. Fold in chocolate chips.
5. Bake in oven for 8-ish mins. They will crack on top, but should still be soft.
