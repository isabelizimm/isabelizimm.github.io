<p>I will always remember PyData Global 2022 as the conference that Hadley Wickham, who is essentially the face of the R language, <strong>talked about Python</strong>. It was a delightful crossover episode in my world. My talk really was an ode to how I learned about MLOps. It goes through what I thought data science looked like when I learned about it in school, only to be SHOCKED that I needed a little bit of practical MLOps knowledge to collaborate with teammates, not lose models into the abyss of <code>version1</code>, <code>version2</code>, <code>version2_final</code>, <code>version_final_forreal</code>, and overall be able to do my job effectively.</p>

<p>PyData always hosts such a great conference, and PyData NYC 2022 was no exception! I met so many cool people, learned a lot of lore about pandas from other talks, and ate some delicious NY-style pizza. This talk is a good reference for explaining why the vetiver framework emphasizes pinning a model and reading it into a Dockerfile, rather than putting the model binary into the Docker container. In short, this is due to the difficulty of updating a model later and doing ad hoc analysis.</p>

  <title>Building an MLOps strategy from the ground up</title>

<p>This was the longest talk I had ever given at 60 minutes, and, on a really personal note, my first keynote presentation. I was so scared, but I came ready with lots of content that I was really excited to share and was welcomed warmly by the whole Crunch crew. The audeince was great, and there were lots of questions about the tricks I taught my dog (which, much like my models, performed well in my living room but not so well in the real world), but also about MLOps and vetiver. This talk is good to listen to if you‚Äôd like to learn more about: - the tension MLOps creates between a software engineering and data science workflows - when and where you can version models with pins - why your DevOps friends might be confused when you say you‚Äôre monitoring a model - how to write good models (from a fairness perspective)</p>

  <title>Demystifying MLOps</title>

  <description><![CDATA[

<p>Data scientists have an intuition of what goes into training a machine learning model, but building an MLOps strategy to deploy that model can sound daunting for data science teams. Model services are not one-size-fits-all, so it is imperative to know a range of tools available. One option, Vetiver, is a framework for R and Python created to make model deployment feel like a natural extension of a data scientist‚Äôs skill set.</p>
<p>This talk offers a high-level overview of what MLOps options are available for model operationalization, but also shows a practical example of an end-to-end MLOps deployment of a model-aware REST API using Vetiver.</p>

<p>This was SUCH a fun conference to go to! The warmth and sense of community in the R world is so apparent; they were pretty accepting of me, a Pythonista üòâ. This talk brings the ways you can deploy models into the mechanics of baking cookies.</p>
<p>P.S. Here is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rage-Against-The-Machine-Learning-Funny-Saying-Quote-T-Shirt/dp/B09B6V31X1?crid=30N0DH4O9VO70&amp;keywords=rage+against+the+machine+learning&amp;qid=1694482994&amp;sprefix=rage+against+the+machine+learning,aps,124&amp;sr=8-1">the shirt I wear in this talk, which reads, ‚ÄúRage against the Machine Learning‚Äù</a>. This is not an affiliate link (but it probably should be after this shirt got so much love at the conference).</p>

  <title>Explaining model explainability</title>
  <link>https://isabelizimm.github.io/talks/berlinbuzzwords2021/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<section id="abstract" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Machine learning doesn‚Äôt have the same objectives as its users. While models look to optimize a function using the given data, humans look to gain insight into their problems. At best, these two objectives align; at worst, machine learning models make the front page of the news for unintended, but astonishing bias. Model explainability algorithms allow data scientists to understand not only what the model outcome is, but why it is being made. This talk will explain what model explainability is, who should care, and show participants how/when to use multiple types of explainability algorithms.</p>
<p>This session shows the usefulness of a variety of algorithms, but also discusses the limitations. Told from a data scientist‚Äôs point of view, this session provides a use case scenario exposing unintended bias using healthcare data. The audience will learn: the basics of model explainability, why this is a relevant issue, how model explainability offers insight into unintended bias, and know how to deploy explainability algorithms in Python with alibi, the open-source library from Seldon.</p>
