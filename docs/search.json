    "text": "Hi there! I’m Isabel. I love creating things, whether that be making DIY crafts or open source tools. I’m keenly interested in making Python an easier and more fun place to do data science work.\nI’ve spent time building Python packages like vetiver and pins as well as larger tools like the Positron IDE. My favorite type of work tends to be at the intersection of practical, user-facing tools and data science. I’m part of the pyOpenSci community, serving as an editor, reviewer, and Editor-in-Chief emeritus (Winter 2024 rotation). I enjoy sharing my work through blog posts and conference talks. I’ve also compiled a more in-depth list of my work.\nCoding is a place for me to be whimsical and creative, but I tend to also do a lot of non-computer hobbies! I’m an avid reader, amateur book-binder, constant doodler (I drew my entire landing page!), and am always teaching my old dog new tricks."

The audience was great, and there were lots of questions about the tricks I taught my dog (which, much like my models, performed well in my living room but not so well in the real world), but also about MLOps and vetiver. This talk is good to listen to if you’d like to learn more about:\n\nthe tension MLOps creates between software engineering and data science workflows\nwhen and where you can version models with pins\nwhy your DevOps friends might be confused when you say you’re monitoring a model\nhow to write good models (from a fairness perspective)"

F-strings are available in Python 3.6+ (earlier versions use format()).\nTo create an f-string, put an f in front of your string literal, then use {} curly braces to add variables or expressions. Here’s how you create a basic f-string:\nYou can see the variable x is embedded directly into the string, producing 'A century is 100 years'."

    "section": "Using Expressions Inside F-Strings",
    "text": "Using Expressions Inside F-Strings\nHere’s where f-strings get really powerful: you can put any Python expression inside the curly braces, not just variables. This means you can do calculations, call functions, or use methods directly inside your string.\nHere’s an example with arithmetic:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; slices_per_pizza = 8\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pizzas = 3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; total_pizza = f\"Total pizza slices: {slices_per_pizza * pizzas}\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(total_pizza)\n'Total pizza slices: 24'\nThe expression slices_per_pizza * pizzas is evaluated when the f-string is created, giving you 'Total pizza slices: 24'. You can also call string methods to transform text on the fly:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; magic_spell = \"abracadabra\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wizard = f\"The wizard cast {magic_spell.upper()}!\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(wizard)\n'The wizard cast ABRACADABRA!'\nThis converts the spell’s name to uppercase, producing 'The wizard cast ABRACADABRA!'. ## Formatting Values\nOne of f-strings’ most useful features is the ability to control how values are displayed. You add formatting instructions by adding a colon : after the variable name inside the curly braces, giving you precise control over your output.\nYou control decimal places with .Nf where N is the number of digits. This is particularly important when working with financial data or scientific calculations:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import math\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pi_digits = f'The first 10 digits of pi are {math.pi:.10f}'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(pi_digits)\n'The first 10 digits of pi are 3.1415926536'\nThis limits pi to 10 decimal places: 'The first 10 digits of pi are 3.1415926536'.\n\nDate Formatting\nWhen working with datetime objects, you can use format codes after the colon. Common codes include %B for full month name, %d for day, and %Y for full year:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime\n&gt;&gt;&gt; square_date = datetime(2025, 9, 16)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; formatted_date = f\"Date: {square_date:%B %d, %Y}\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(formatted_date)\n'Date: September 16, 2025'\nThis produces a nicely formatted date: 'Date: September 16, 2025'."

The newline character is displayed as \\\\n instead of being interpreted. The !a conversion works like !r but uses ascii() to escape non-ASCII characters.\nYou can also use = after your expression to show both the expression and its value:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; movie_rating = 8.7\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"The value of {movie_rating=}\"\n'The value of movie_rating=8.7'\nWhere the output This saves you from typing the variable name twice.\nF-strings are the modern, preferred way to format strings in Python.

My complete knowledge of Blender was that it was good for smoothies and also animation(?). But, I like to think I’m a sort of creative person. I like to learn and make new things. I was certainly a dummy in this context. Why not try it out?\nI logged in (it’s freemium software), and opened up one of the templates provided. There were many instructional videos and tutorials to teach you how to use the software, but I went in headfirst and hoped for the best. If you have used Photoshop-y applications before, the layout might look vaguely reminiscient. There’s a pane on the left showing all the objects in a scene, and a pane on the right to edit a selected object. There’s buttons on top to drop you into the world, add new shapes, and easily export your scene.\nHere’s my “The Intersection” that shows a split between two ecosystems. Walk around, flip over the bench, stand on some dinosaur bones, fall off the edge into eternal darkness, there is no plot! Click on the graphic, then you can use the arrow keys to change the camera and WASD keys to move the bunny plus space bar to jump.\n\nSpline is not the software where Fortnite is developed. But, it doesn’t need to be. It’s a delightful tool that is easily understood, has a simple UI that doesn’t require you to know everything to be productive, and offers great templates to build from. My goal was never to change career paths into game design; my goal was to make something that isn’t too embarrassingly bad to put in a blog post and have some fun along the way.\nAnyway, like most software, Spline is a good example of the fact that sometimes you don’t need the best tool for the job, you need the best tool for you."

My favorite tools right now are pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv, which keep me mostly out of trouble, but there is some extra legwork to get them set up with RStudio IDE.\nI usually start by checking what Python is being used by going to the RStudio console and running:\nreticulate::py_config()\nThis gives me:\npython:         /usr/bin/python3\nlibpython:      /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/config-3.8-darwin/libpython3.8.dylib\npythonhome:     /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8\nversion:        3.8.9 (default, Aug  3 2021, 19:21:54)  [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.3)]\nnumpy:           [NOT FOUND]\nwhich is nice, since at least some sort of Python is THERE, but I want to follow the Golden Rule: don’t touch the system Python.\nTime to do some environment gymnastics. My first move is to allow pyenv to share its environment, which is required to use envs with reticulate.\nenv PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=\"--enable-shared\" pyenv install 3.9.4\npyenv virtualenv 3.9.4 newenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you skip this step, you will get an error similar to:\nError: '/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.11/envs/pydemo/bin/python' was not \nbuilt with a shared library. reticulate can only bind to copies of Python \nbuilt with '--enable-shared'.\n\n\nNext, we’re going to restart the R session, and try to just add this new Python environment in there. The key here is RESTART R SESSION (on macOS, this is commmand+shift+0) and then DON’T TRY TO RUN ANYTHING IN PYTHON BEFORE THESE NEXT FEW COMMANDS. If you “just try to run one thing to see if {insert ridiculous Python MultiEnvironmentVerse of Madness strategy} worked,” you will end up in an endless loop of setting environment variables that are ignored since they are already initialized (this sentence is hard-won for me).

We can do this by:\nSys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON='/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/bin/python')\nand then check to see if it worked since we have pretty strong trust issues.\nSys.getenv(\"RETICULATE_PYTHON\")\n[1] \"/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/bin/python\"\nPromising!

We can update that file to look like:\nexport RETICULATE_PYTHON=/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/bin/python\n\n\nIT WORKED! Time to run all the Python I can. I’m fully open to better workflows if you have them, but for now, this gets me on my way when I feel the despair of another broken Python environment.\nAlso, S/O to Firas Sadiyah’s blog post on pyenv + RStudio which has helped me many a time to get on the right track!"

    "text": "The journey\nRecently, the team dedicated a month to reading about the world of MLOps, as it is today. We all read the fantastic book Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen and split up numerous other academic articles and web content between ourselves. The world of machine learning operations moves fast, and we wanted to ensure the choices we had made early on (eg, focusing on versioning, deploying, and monitoring) would serve data practitioners best.\nAfter reading many different definitions of MLOps, the one we found most useful is: “a set of practices to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.” While not every MLOps practice is applicable at scale for every team, these best practices can elevate any size of project.\nMLOps applies the same basic principles as DevOps (development operations) in a specialized machine learning context. One common point of tension in MLOps is that data science is highly experimental and iterative compared to general purpose software delivery, but deploying to a production environment still requires reliable software engineering delivery practices. To help ease this pain point, APIs are commonly used to deploy models due to their stability and simplicity. APIs can be tested, and they act nearly identically in every architecture. This allows for software engineering practices to be applied to APIs. They have a straightforward architecture to configure and update, giving data scientists agility to retrain and update models as needed.\nTools labeled as “MLOps frameworks” have a broad scope. Tasks generally fall into one of a few different categories:\n\nOrchestration or pipelines\nExperiment tracking\nModel versioning\nModel deployment\nModel monitoring\n\nVetiver spans a few of these tasks, but is not a tool built for orchestration or experiment tracking. Rather, Vetiver focuses on the practices of versioning, deploying, and monitoring and will continue building support for these tasks."

Feedback loops are a place where bias in models can aggregate undetected. Any continuous monitoring support necessitates careful thought on how to uncover model (un)fairness.\nThe composability of vetiver with other projects, such as MLFlow or Metaflow, is needed to allow practitioners to build an MLOps framework that is flexible and meets the need of their team. Composability in this sense also includes platform agnosticism for public clouds such as Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Currently, generic Dockerfiles exist that can be hosted on these platforms, but extended documentation is needed for specific workflows."

(They always win when I use this model to write blog posts on game days, and I fear a replay of the 2016 season when our win-loss ratio was 3-13 if I change my ways.)\nOftentimes you need to deploy more than one model. Even if the fate of your favorite NFL team isn’t depending upon your models’ locations, it’s important to understand where these models should be living. tldr;\n\nInput data is the same -&gt; use one API\nInput data is not the same -&gt; use multiple APIs\n\n(These are not definitive rules. A lot of this is dependent upon architecture, how your deployment is set up, what works best for your organization, etc. Also, vetiver allows you to break both of these rules!)\nIf your models are unrelated and the input data is different, you probably want to put them on different APIs. However, if the input data is the same for multiple different models, it might make sense to deploy them on the same API, but at different endpoints.\nFor our Chicago train ridership data, we ALWAYS want to predict ridership from the same parameters every time. However, if the data indicates it was a home game for the Chicago Bears, we want to use our lucky model.\nLet’s start by loading some data and use tidymodels to put all our preprocessing in one recipe.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\ndata(Chicago)\n\nchicago_small &lt;- Chicago %&gt;% slice(1:730) # two years of data\n\nchicago_rec &lt;-\n  recipe(ridership ~ ., data = Chicago) %&gt;%\n  step_date(date) %&gt;%\n  step_holiday(date, keep_original_cols = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %&gt;%\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) %&gt;%\n  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %&gt;%\n  step_pca(all_of(stations), num_comp = 4)\n\nWe can then use tidymodels to make multiple different models quickly. Notice that I am actually putting my preprocessing recipe in the recipe with my model. This is intentional, and best practice for modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFeature engineering is part of your model workflow. You should be packaging this up with your model and deploying it as part of your model workflow. In Python, this involves using something like scikit learn Pipelines. In R, this involves using something like tidymodels workflows.\n\n\n\nBuild a few models for home games (support vectors for extra support at home):\n\ntree_model &lt;-\n  svm_linear() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"LiblineaR\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"regression\")\n\nhome_game_model &lt;-\n  workflow(chicago_rec, tree_model) %&gt;%\n  fit(chicago_small)\n\nAnd not home games:\n\nlinear_model &lt;-\n  linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\nnot_home_game_model &lt;-\n  workflow(chicago_rec, tree_model) %&gt;% \n  fit(chicago_small)\n\nNext, I will make some deployable model objects, or vetiver_model, with the vetiver package.\n\nlibrary(vetiver)\n\nhome &lt;- vetiver_model(home_game_model, \"home\")\nnot_home &lt;- vetiver_model(not_home_game_model, \"not_home\")\n\nNormally we would be iterating through models and possibly versioning them as well, but let’s skip that step and go right to deployment.\nI’ll deploy these two models on ONE plumber API by using a combination of vetiver_pr_post() and vetiver_pr_docs() along with the path argument.\n\nlibrary(plumber)\n\npr() %&gt;% \n  vetiver_pr_post(home, path = \"/home_game\") %&gt;% \n  vetiver_pr_docs(home) %&gt;% \n  vetiver_pr_post(not_home, path = \"/not_home_game\") %&gt;% \n  vetiver_pr_docs(not_home) %&gt;% \n  pr_run()\n\nNow, to make predictions, I will route data to each endpoint respectively. To do this on your own computer, you will have to run the above commands as background job (or deploy it with docker.)\nWe can make predictions at each endpoint with data. Of course this can be as complex or simple as you desire, but here’s the meat-and-potatoes of it.\n\nhome_endpoint &lt;- vetiver_endpoint('http://127.0.0.1:5331/home_game')\n\nhome_data &lt;- Chicago %&gt;%\n  filter(Bears_Home == 1) %&gt;%\n  tail(5)\n\npredict(home_endpoint, home_data)\n\n\nnot_home_endpoint &lt;- vetiver_endpoint('http://127.0.0.1:5331/not_home_game')\n\nnot_home_data &lt;- Chicago %&gt;%\n  filter(Bears_Home == 0) %&gt;%\n  tail(5)\n\npredict(not_home_endpoint, not_home_data)\n\nWe have now created an API with multiple models at various endpoints, and successfully interacted with them!

    "text": "Starting out\nIf you’re wanting to invest a books-length amount of time into learning about MLOps, Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen is my number one recommendation. This book has information for the whole machine learning lifecycle from building a model to building a system for that model to live in. If you’re mostly interested in the MLOps parts, I recommend starting with chapters 2, 7, 8, 9, and 11.\nMLOps Principles is a culmination of a lot of the most-cited MLOps literature, so if you’re wanting a starting point with lots of side quest opportunities, this is a good place to start. I particularly liked the idea of “Continuous X”; this extends the idea of CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) to include Continuous Training and Continuous Delivery. It highlights out an important piece of MLOps: it’s never finished.\nIf you’re interested in learning what “real” MLOps people do, “Operationalizing Machine Learning: An Interview Study” by Shreya Shankar et al is the article to read. This piece feels foundational to me. There is important discussion about the fundamental differences between building models and building traditional software, why not every model gets deployed, and much much more. It’s a digestable paper, and I highly recommend reading this one all the way through.\nAnd, I can’t write this without giving a personal plug: I’ve given a number of MLOps talks, which you can view at the “Talks” tab on this page! A good “starting point” talk of mine is Demystifying MLOps, which I presented at rstudio::conf(2022)."

If you’re interested in the pain points of How ML Breaks: A Decade of Outages for One Large ML Pipeline by Papasian and Underwood. This video walks through all the ways the ML pipeline at Google has broken; breakages are categorized in numerous ways, but one particularly interesting one is ML failures/Non-ML failures. Spoiler alert: most failures were not machine learning failures.\nWith a model in production, you’ll want to monitor it. Reliable Maintenance of Machine Learning Models by Julia Silge is a great overview of why you should be monitoring models. This talk outlines what “performing well” means to different stakeholders of model systems and explains the multiple types of drift that can happen once your model is out in the wild.\nIf you have implemented MLOps practices, “The ML Test Score: A Rubric for ML Production Readiness and Technical Debt Reduction” by E.Breck et al. 2017 is a must read. It shows and rates a practical progression of machine learning systems, which is often not adding versioning systems -&gt; adding model deployment -&gt; starting to monitor models; rather, it usually follows the pattern of systems are not implemented -&gt; systems are implemented manually -&gt; systems are run automatically.\nEvent streaming won’t be a required skill for all people who are using MLOps practices. However, if you want to learn about it, Gently Down the Stream by Mitch Seymour is a children’s book which also happens to be the best explanation of Kafka I have ever read. Plus it is an adorable, digestible, maybe 5-minute read.\nFinally– if you’ve devoured this list and are still hungry for more, MLOps guide by Chip Huyen is a secondary curated list of MLOps content that I have gone through and absolutely adore."

    "title": "Github Actions all the way down",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The lore\nI spent a while exploring how Python packages are made. It’s the wild west out there. There’s too many setup files, testing frameworks, no agreed-upon directory structure, and generally enough information to make your head spin. Luckily, you can use tools like cookiecutter to quickly get started (once you figure out which cookiecutter you want to use). For my use case, I wanted to make a simple cookiecutter, but wanted to run some tests to make sure my configuration of files did all the things I expected it to do.\nThe workflow was:\n1. Edit my `cookiecutter`. \n2. Run my cookiecutter to make a new package. \n3. Push my new package to Github. \n4. Run Github Actions. \n5. Realize I messed up in step 1.\nBut what if, Github Actions could use the cookie cutter repo to create ANOTHER repo to automatically generate your package? And what if that freshly cookie-cut repo would run its own Github Actions to ensure everything was properly set up? Useless? Most likely. But, I was going to do it anyway.\n\n\nSee it in (Github) action\nGitHub Action that pushes to a different repo.\nGitHub Actions in receiving repo that runs once a push has been made.\n\n\nSet up\nYou will need two different repos, a sending repo and receiving repo. In my case, the sending repo generates a cookiecutter template for a Python package, and then the receiving repo is the output package. You don’t have to be familiar with cookiecutter templates to understand this gist, but they’re worth a quick click if organization brings you joy.\nBefore running your chain reaction of actions, a few pieces need to be set up. The receiving repo cannot be empty, so I just initialized it with an empty README.md. The next part is probably the most difficult if you’re unfamiliar, which is generating an SSH key, click here for instructions. Once you’ve gone into the terminal and generated the key, add the PUBLIC KEY to your SENDING repo and the PRIVATE KEY to your RECEIVING repo.\n\n\nReady, ACTION!\nThe GitHub Action that sets off this package creation is below, or you can see the action in the repo, for context. Note: there are difference between the code below and the code in the repo, these changes were made for clarity and should not impact performance.\n# Creates cookie cutter and pushes to new repo\nname: Generate Cookiecutter\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  \njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n      - name: Install requirements\n        run: pip install cookiecutter\n      - name: Make cookiecutter with default inputs\n        run: cookiecutter --no-input .\n      - name: Send to receiving repo\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}\n          external_repository: isabelizimm/making-cookies\n          publish_branch: dev-branch\n          publish_dir: ./my_new_package\n          exclude_assets: ''\nReally, the most important part here is the Send to receiving repo step. You see here that your sender deploy key is being utilized and the external repository and branch is specified. This Action will normally exclude certain files (in particular, we need .github/ from the template) on push, which is we have to manually set exclude_assets: ' ' so all files are being pushed.\nOnce this action is running successfully, you will see a new branch, dev-branch, on the receiving repo, making-cookies. Congratulations! The hard part is finished.\nThe second set of actions is less magical. This template package has built-in GitHub Actions to jump-start running tests and building docs. This second set of actions runs on push to any branch named “dev-*”, so they automatically start after the initial push to the branch from the sending repo.\nHopefully this helps (or at least gives a starting point) others who are also exploring the capabilites of CI! Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or struggles. :)\ncheers, iz"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Starting to write a new conference proposal (also called an abstract) is my least favorite part of any conference experience. I’ll think I have a half-decent idea, but then I open up a blank document and feel like I should be able to articulate my thoughts in a surprising-yet-thought-provoking, high-tech-yet-accessible, gentle-yet-striking way. After a first draft, I’ll reread my work and realize the most striking thing that occurred was I wrote a sentence that was 15 lines long, of which 6 lines are actually related to what I wanted to talk about and the rest are talking about the fact I’d like to talk about it. Also, I typed “teh” instead of “the.” It’s scary! Conference committee members use these few words to evaluate your topic’s fit into the conference schedule, and it will likely be the only context attendees use to determine if they want to watch your session. The overall goal of an abstract is to 1) inform the reader what your topic is about and 2) give compelling reasons to invest time and mental bandwidth in your ideas. Abstracts are an art form, but also a skill you can build to make the whole experience feel a little bit easier.\nLike solving any good engineering problem, the first step is to read the documentation (even if you feel like you already know what should be done). The conference likely has a page or two about the kinds of talks they are interested in, the length of an abstract, and previous talks. Note if there is a maximum length; double check if that length is characters or words. Check out the topics of previously accepted submissions to do a sanity check if your work fits in with prior art. A little bit of reading here is worthwhile to make sure you are setting yourself up for success in the submission stage.\nIf you are considering is my idea worth a submission?– the answer is YES! You have unique ideas, experiences, and thought processes that people want to hear. Learning how you and your team approached and solved a difficult problem, why you chose one framework over another, or even well-researched hot-takes all make for great presentations. If a full length talk seems too overwhelming, many conferences have lightning talks that are 3-10 minutes long you can sign up for beforehand or during the conference itself. Lightning talks are lots of fun; Tracy Teal has put together a great guide on how to prepare lightning talks.\nStart with a list of what you hope to achieve in your talk. At the very least, have your main topic plus, why people should care, and what people will learn. This list will become your guiding light on what really matters when you are tempted to add feature lists to your abstract.\nDuring a panel discussion on How to Get a Paper Accepted at OOPSLA, Kent Beck’s advice was that a good abstract only needs four sentences:\n\nThe first [sentence] states the problem. The second states why the problem is a problem. The third is my startling sentence. The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.\n\nMost of the abstracts I write follow some loose interpretation of this four-sentence rule. The first sentence in an abstract should clearly explain the pain point you are trying to resolve in your talk; the second sentence is why that pain point matters. The third sentence is where you explain how your work solves the problem, or otherwise is the main idea of the talk. Finally, the fourth sentence is where you get to envision a world where someone uses your third-sentence solution. What process has been improved, what friction has been alleviated, or what has otherwise improved in someone’s life due to your talk? Make an argument as to why your talk is worth attending.\nIn the case of longer abstracts, I usually end up with three-ish paragraphs.\n\nThe first paragraph is created using the four-sentence rule.\nThe second paragraph provides evidence of why your solution is the best choice.\nThe third and final paragraph describes what knowledge listeners should know when they walk away.\n\nThe evidence outlined in the second paragraph will probably become the main subpoints in a slide deck when you are presenting. Think of the reasons why you believe your main idea is correct. Maybe you’re writing about how framework X is the best one; this paragraph could mention that framework X supports many relevant data types, is able to be integrated into the cloud backend that your team uses, and has a great community that helps answer all your questions. The third paragraph should answer the question: What will I know at the end of this talk, that I don’t know now? Keep in mind that the average listener will not walk away as an advanced user of your solution, since they will probably only remember 10% of your talk by the time they get back home. They might, however, still remember why your solution is a good idea and when to use it. The last 1-2 sentences of the abstract can be a recap of the problem and solution outlined in the first paragraph.\nWith the structure done, reread your abstract once and check for misspelled words, clarify any confusing wording, and remove or explain jargon. Jargon for one industry may be common knowledge in another, but use your best judgment on what is reasonable; have a friend or colleague read through your work as a second opinion if you’re not sure!\nIt’s easy to fall into the trap where you want to write your whole talk out when you are given a healthy word count to do so. Do remember that a limit is just that, a limit. Clearly outline the points you are going to make and why they are important, but this is not the time to explain all the details. Readers will appreciate brevity, so long as you give enough information that they can assess the relevance of your talk to their interests. It may help to remember who you are writing this abstract for:\n\nIf I am sure to consider my audience – first, an overworked program committee member, and second, a jetlagged and overstimulated conference attendee – I am far more likely to explain things clearly and eschew jargon. (William Benton’s excellent blog post “Concrete advice about abstracts”)\n\nYou’ll want to have thought about your talk content, but in the abstract submission phase, it is not necessary to have a script or slides or anything extra prepared until you hear if your abstract is accepted.\nHappy conference season, wishing you all accepted talks!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "My partner, Val, has been asking to making a fancy Quarto blog. Today, we’re going through this step-by-step together. There’s a few different ways to do this, and the RStudio IDE has UI to make this a pretty slick process. However, I don’t spend much time in RStudio, so here’s my IDE agnostic workflow. You’ll need:\n\nA GitHub account\nTo install Quarto here if you haven’t yet\nAccess to the command line (eg, “Terminal” on a Mac)\n\n\nStep 1: Make the repository\nGo to github.com and click on your profile image in the top right corner. In the dropdown, click on Your repositories and then click New to create a new repository.\n\nCreate a new repository in GitHub and name it your-github-username.github.io. This is a secret repository structure in GitHub to host a blog for your account! Next, open up the terminal and use the cd command to navigate to the folder you would like to store your blog in. Use the command git clone {repository-url} to copy the repository onto your computer, and cd your-github-username.github.io into your local version.\n\n\nStep 2: Create blog\nIn the folder for your repository, type quarto create project blog . into your CLI tool and press enter. Congratulations, you have built a blog! Use quarto preview to build and view it locally.\n\n\nStep 3: Update the blog\nThere’s a few places you will want to update before you publish your blog for the world to see. First, open up the file called index.qmd and add some information about yourself. I have a few sentences of introduction, my education, and how to get in contact with me. Next, open up the folder called posts/ and update it to remove the default posts. If you’d like to write a blog post of your own, the easiest way to organize the posts is by making each one into its own folder. Then, each folder can contain a .qmd, .md, .Rmd, or .ipynb file as a post and any relevant images.\nFor simple aesthetics, you can go to the _quarto.yml file and try out different bootstrap themes, or add some color to your navbar by adding a background field to your navbar\nwebsite:\n  title: \"my blog\"\n  description: \"my personal blog\"\n  navbar:\n    background: \"#ffccff\" # accepts color names like red, blue, or hex codes\n\n\nStep 4: Push to Github Pages\nWhile still in the folder of your blog, run quarto publish gh-pages. You will be prompted with some text like: Publish site to your-github-username.github.io? Accept this, and let it run.\n\n\nStep 5: Set the deployment branch to gh-pages\nBack to GitHub, view your repository. Go to the settings for the repo, and click on Pages. Then, change the Build and deploy from source to the gh-pages branch.\n\nIf you go back to the main page of your repository, you will see a tab Deployments underneath the repository description. The green checkmark means your blog has been successfully deployed! The url will be something like your-github-username.github.io\nGoing forward, each time you want to update your website, you can reuse the quarto publish gh-pages command."

A geom_map to generate the map, geom_point to place each circle depicting number and type of cheeses, and two geom_text elements for the country name and number of cheeses.

They combine plain text and markdown for writing narrative content with simple formatting (headings, lists, links, etc.), YAML frontmatter at the top for metadata like title, date, and formatting options, and code chunks that can either be displayed statically or executed when you render the site.\nWhen you render your website, Quarto will execute the code and display both the code and its output on your website. This is perfect for data science portfolios where you want to showcase both your code and its results. Check out the Quarto gallery for inspiration on what’s possible."

    "text": "Build your website locally\n\nCreate new folder from template\nLet’s start by creating a dedicated folder for your website project. This keeps everything organized and self-contained. All your blog posts, images, and configuration files will live in one place. In Positron, we’ll use the built-in project creation tools to set up this folder structure properly.\n\n\n\nChoose empty project\nWhen Positron asks what type of project to create, select “Empty Project.” Starting with an empty project gives us a clean slate to build our blog. This also will make Positron open your new folder automatically.\n\n\n\nName your folder\nNow comes an important naming decision. If you plan to host your site on GitHub Pages, name this folder GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io, replacing GITHUB-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.\nFor example, my GitHub username is isabelizimm, so I’d the folder isabelizimm.github.io. This specific naming convention tells GitHub to automatically host your site at https://janedoe.github.io. If you’re using Quarto Pub instead, you can choose any name you like.\n\n\n\nView new folder\nGreat! Positron has created your project folder and opened it as your active workspace. You should see a clean, empty project structure in the file explorer on the left side of the window. You’ll know you’re in the right place because you’ll see the name of your folder in the top left corner.\nThis folder is now the root directory of your future website. Everything we create from here will be relative to this location.\n\n\n\nClick on “Search bar at the top”\nNow we’ll use Positron’s command palette. This is a super-powered way to navigate through many of the IDE features. Click on the search bar at the top of the window. From here, select Show and Run Commands to open the full command palette where we can find Quarto-specific commands. You can also open the Command palette using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).\n\n\n\nRun Quarto: Create Project\nIn the command palette that appears, type Quarto: Create Project and select this option from the list. You don’t need to type the whole thing—Positron will filter the commands as you type.\nThis command launches Quarto’s project creation wizard, which will walk us through setting up a proper Quarto blog structure with all the necessary configuration files.\n\n\n\nCreate Blog Project\nQuarto gives you two main options here: Website or Blog. You can always switch this later, a blog can become a website or vice versa. To help you choose:\n\nBlog: Perfect for a portfolio site where you’ll be publishing dated posts, articles, or project write-ups. When I was a student, I would create a new blog post each class to take notes! It was a really nice way to organize and display information, and I had a nice course portfolio at the end of each semester.\nWebsite: Better for static content like documentation or a simple landing page.\n\nFor a portfolio showcasing your data science projects, a blog is usually the better choice.\n\n\n\nPopulate website in your GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io directory\nWhen prompted to select a directory, navigate to and select the folder you created earlier—the one named GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io (or whatever you named it if not using GitHub Pages).\nQuarto will populate this folder with a complete blog template, including sample posts, configuration files, and styling. This gives you a fully functional blog right out of the box that you can customize however you’d like.\n\n\n\nSee your beautiful blog!\nCongratulations! You now have a fully functional blog structure. Take a moment to explore the files Quarto created:\n\n_quarto.yml is the core configuration file of your website. This is where you’ll customize your site’s title, navigation menu, theme, and other global settings.\nFiles ending in *.qmd are Quarto Markdown files—these are your actual blog posts and pages. Each .qmd file becomes a page on your website.\nThe posts/ directory contains your blog posts, each in its own folder.\nindex.qmd is your homepage.\n\nTo preview your site, open any *.qmd file and click the Preview button in the top right. Positron will render your site and open it in a browser window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn the _quarto.yml file, there is a line that says something like site-url: https://your-website-url.example.com. In order to publish properly, you’ll need to delete this line. Failure to do so may cause errors at time of deployment!"

    "text": "Deploy your site\nNow that you have a blog locally, it’s time to share it with the world! The deployment process differs slightly depending on whether you’re using GitHub Pages or Quarto Pub.\n\nGitHub PagesQuarto Pub\n\n\n\nCreate repository for your blog\nFirst, head to GitHub and create a new repository. This is crucial: the repository must be named exactly your-username.github.io, where your-username matches your GitHub username exactly. This special naming convention tells GitHub to treat this as a GitHub Pages site and host it at that URL. Make sure to create it as a public repository. GitHub Pages only works with public repos on the free tier.\n\n\n\nCopy command from GitHub\nAfter creating the repository, GitHub will show you a setup page with several commands. Look for the section titled “…or push an existing repository from the command line” and copy those commands.\nThese commands will connect your local blog folder to your GitHub repository and push your files up to GitHub.\n\n\n\nPaste command in terminal\nBack in Positron, make sure you’re in the TERMINAL tab at the bottom of the window (not the CONSOLE tab, which is for running R or Python code).\nPaste the commands you copied from GitHub and press Enter. This will initialize a git repository in your folder, connect it to GitHub, and push your files. You may be prompted to log into GitHub, follow the authentication flow if needed.\n\n\n\nPublish blog to GitHub Pages\nIt is time to publish your blog! In the terminal, run:\nquarto publish gh-pages\nThis command does several things automatically:\n\nRenders your entire website\nCreates a special gh-pages branch in your repository\nPushes the rendered HTML files to that branch\nConfigures GitHub Pages to serve your site\n\nQuarto will ask for confirmation—type ‘Y’ and press Enter. In a few moments, your site will be live on the internet.\n\n\n\nConfigure GitHub Pages settings\nAlmost there! Go to your GitHub repository in your browser, click on Settings → Pages (in the left sidebar).\nUnder “Source,” select “Deploy from a branch” and choose the gh-pages branch from the dropdown. Leave the folder as / (root).\nClick Save. GitHub will now automatically serve your website whenever you update it. Your site will be live at https://your-username.github.io within a few minutes!\n\n\n\nSend your source code to GitHub\nThere’s one final step: pushing your source files (the .qmd files) to GitHub’s main branch. This is separate from the gh-pages branch that contains your rendered HTML.\nIn Positron’s Source Control panel (the icon that looks like a funky Y with circles), you’ll see all your files listed. Click the + icon to stage all changes, add a commit message like “Initial blog setup,” and click the checkmark.\nThen click “Sync changes” to send your source files to GitHub. Now both your source code and your rendered website are safely stored on GitHub!\n\n\n\n\n\nPublish blog to Quarto Pub\nQuarto Pub is slightly simpler than GitHub Pages, but has the drawback of not hosting source code. In the terminal, run:\nquarto publish quarto-pub\nThe first time you do this, Quarto will open a browser window asking you to authorize the connection to Quarto Pub. Follow the prompts to log in and grant permission.\nYou’ll then be asked to choose a name for your site—this will be part of your URL (like yourname.quarto.pub). Choose something professional and memorable, like portfolio.\nThat’s it! Your site will be live at https://yourname.quarto.pub/portfolio in seconds. Every time you want to update your site, just run quarto publish quarto-pub again."
