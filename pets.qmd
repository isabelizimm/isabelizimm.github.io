## Toast

Toast is my dog! 
He gets a special place on my blog because 1) he is very cute and 2) he deserves partial credit for being my devoted coding rubber duck for many years. 
He knows over 30 tricks and has competed in [barn hunt](https://www.barnhunt.com/index.html) and [agility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_agility).

## Maple

Maple was one of our numerous foster dogs, but she fit in with the family so well tha she had to stay!
Maple is mostly interested in squirrels and giving people hugs.
Like Toast, she enjoys [barn hunt](https://www.barnhunt.com/index.html.

## Squash and Olive

Squash (orange) and Olive (tuxedo) are grouped together since they are so inseperable!
Squash likes: tipping over any container containing water, climbing bookshelves, causing problems in general.
Olive likes: babies (human, cat, dog, she loves them all), getting fed, eating Squash's eyebrows.
