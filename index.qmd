Hello! ðŸ‘¾ I am a software engineer at [Posit, PBC](https://posit.co/), where I build Python-based open source data science tools. I'm a current member of the triage team and an Emeritus Editor in Chief at [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/), an organization that supports scientific Python tools by offering peer reviews of packages, education, other community building. I graduated from [Florida Polytechnic University](https://floridapoly.edu/) with my Masters in Computer Science, focused in Data Science. When not thinking about computers, I enjoy reading and doing dog sports such as [agility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_agility) and [barn hunt](https://barnhunt.com/about_bh.html).
