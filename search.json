    "title": "Abstracts are art",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Writing a conference proposal (often called an abstract) can feel daunting at first. Conference committee members will be using it to evaluate your topic’s fit into the conference schedule, and it will likely be the talk description attendees use to determine if they want to join your session. The overall goal of an abstract is to inform the reader what your topic is about and give compelling reasons for them to invest their time and mental bandwidth into your ideas. Abstracts are an art form, but also a skill you can build on!\nAs with any good engineering problem, the first step is to read the documentation. The conference likely has a page or two about the kinds of talks they are interested in, the length of an abstract, and previous talks. It’s worth the time to read through this information. Make sure to note if there is a maximum length. Double check if that length is characters or words (if it hasn’t messed you up at least once yet, it will). Note the topics of previously accepted submissions, does your content fit in with prior art? Take this information and determine if the conference is a suitable fit for the content you would like to present. If so, time to begin!\nEven if it’s a few simple bullet points, start with a list of what you hope to achieve. At the very least, have your main topic plus at least two sub-topics, why people should care, and what people will walk away knowing. This list will become your guiding light on what really matters when you are tempted to add feature lists to your abstract.\nDuring a panel discussion on How to Get a Paper Accepted at OOPSLA, Kent Beck’s advice was that a good abstract only needs four sentences:\n\nThe first [sentence] states the problem. The second states why the problem is a problem. The third is my startling sentence. The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.\n\nMost of the abstracts I write follow some loose interpretation of this four-sentence rule. The first sentence in an abstract should clearly explain the pain point you are trying to resolve in your talk; the second sentence is why that pain point matters. The third sentence is where you explain how your work solves the problem, or otherwise is the main idea of the talk. Finally, the fourth sentence is where you get to envision a world where someone uses your third-sentence solution. What process has been improved, what friction has been alleviated, or what has otherwise improved in someone’s life due to your talk? Make an argument as to why your talk is worth attending.\nIn the case of longer abstracts, I usually end up with three paragraphs. The first paragraph is created using the four (ish) sentence model. The second paragraph provides evidence of why your solution is the best choice. The evidence outlined here will probably become the main subpoints in a slide deck when you are presenting. The third and final paragraph describes what knowledge listeners should know when they walk away. Keep in mind that listeners will NOT walk away with the ability to apply your ideas in a complex way, since they will probably only remember 10% of your talk by the time they get back home. They might, however, know what your solution is and when to use it. The last 1-2 sentences of this paragraph also recap the problem and solution outlined in the first paragraph. It’s easy to fall into the trap where you want to write your whole talk out when you are given a healthy word count to do so. Do remember that a limit is just that, a limit. There is no need to fill your abstract with extra nonsense just to meet that limit. Clearly outline the points you are going to make and why they are important, but this is not the time to explain all the details. It may help to remember who you are writing this abstract for:\n\nIf I am sure to consider my audience – first, an overworked program committee member, and second, a jetlagged and overstimulated conference attendee – I am far more likely to explain things clearly and eschew jargon. (William Benton’s excellent blog post “Concrete advice about abstracts”)\n\nIn fact, oftentimes readers will appreciate brevity, so long as you give enough information that they can assess the relevance of your talk to their work.\nWith the structure done, reread your abstract once and check for misspelled words, clarify any confusing wording, and remove jargon. Not everyone will be familiar with the terms you know, and your abstract will be accessible to a wider audience if you write in language that others understand. Jargon for one industry may be common knowledge in another, but use your best judgment on what is reasonable; have a friend or colleague read through your work as a second opinion if you’re not sure! You’ll want to have thought about your talk content, but in the abstract submission phase, it is not necessary to have a script or slides or anything extra prepared until you hear if your abstract is accepted.\nFinally, if you are considering is X idea worth a submission? the answer is YES! You have unique ideas, experiences, and thought processes that people want to hear. If a full length talk seems too overwhelming, many conferences have lightning talks that are 5-10 minutes long you can sign up for beforehand or during the conference. Remember not all presentations are about ground-breaking new technology you developed. Learning how you and your team approached and solved a difficult problem, why you chose one framework over another, or even well-researched hot-takes all make for great presentations.\nHappy conference season, wishing you all accepted talks!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The lore\nI spent a while exploring how Python packages are made. It’s the wild west out there. There’s too many setup files, testing frameworks, no agreed-upon directory structure, and generally enough information to make your head spin. Luckily, you can use tools like cookiecutter to quickly get started (once you figure out which cookiecutter you want to use). For my use case, I wanted to make a simple cookiecutter, but wanted to run some tests to make sure my configuration of files did all the things I expected it to do.\nThe workflow was:\n1. Edit my `cookiecutter`. \n2. Run my cookiecutter to make a new package. \n3. Push my new package to Github. \n4. Run Github Actions. \n5. Realize I messed up in step 1.\nBut what if, Github Actions could use the cookie cutter repo to create ANOTHER repo to automatically generate your package? And what if that freshly cookie-cut repo would run its own Github Actions to ensure everything was properly set up? Useless? Most likely. But, I was going to do it anyway.\n\n\nSee it in (Github) action\nGitHub Action that pushes to a different repo.\nGitHub Actions in receiving repo that runs once a push has been made.\n\n\nSet up\nYou will need two different repos, a sending repo and receiving repo. In my case, the sending repo generates a cookiecutter template for a Python package, and then the receiving repo is the output package. You don’t have to be familiar with cookiecutter templates to understand this gist, but they’re worth a quick click if organization brings you joy.\nBefore running your chain reaction of actions, a few pieces need to be set up. The receiving repo cannot be empty, so I just initialized it with an empty README.md. The next part is probably the most difficult if you’re unfamiliar, which is generating an SSH key, click here for instructions. Once you’ve gone into the terminal and generated the key, add the PUBLIC KEY to your SENDING repo and the PRIVATE KEY to your RECEIVING repo.\n\n\nReady, ACTION!\nThe GitHub Action that sets off this package creation is below, or you can see the action in the repo, for context. Note: there are difference between the code below and the code in the repo, these changes were made for clarity and should not impact performance.\n# Creates cookie cutter and pushes to new repo\nname: Generate Cookiecutter\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  \njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n      - name: Install requirements\n        run: pip install cookiecutter\n      - name: Make cookiecutter with default inputs\n        run: cookiecutter --no-input .\n      - name: Send to receiving repo\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}\n          external_repository: isabelizimm/making-cookies\n          publish_branch: dev-branch\n          publish_dir: ./my_new_package\n          exclude_assets: ''\nReally, the most important part here is the Send to receiving repo step. You see here that your sender deploy key is being utilized and the external repository and branch is specified. This Action will normally exclude certain files (in particular, we need .github/ from the template) on push, which is we have to manually set exclude_assets: ' ' so all files are being pushed.\nOnce this action is running successfully, you will see a new branch, dev-branch, on the receiving repo, making-cookies. Congratulations! The hard part is finished.\nThe second set of actions is less magical. This template package has built-in GitHub Actions to jump-start running tests and building docs. This second set of actions runs on push to any branch named “dev-*”, so they automatically start after the initial push to the branch from the sending repo.\nHopefully this helps (or at least gives a starting point) others who are also exploring the capabilites of CI! Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or struggles. :)\ncheers, iz"

    "section": "The journey",
    "text": "The journey\nRecently, the team dedicated a month to reading about the world of MLOps, as it is today. We all read the fantastic book Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen and split up numerous other academic articles and web content between ourselves. The world of machine learning operations moves fast, and we wanted to ensure the choices we had made early on (eg, focusing on versioning, deploying, and monitoring) would serve data practitioners best.\nAfter reading many different definitions of MLOps, the one we found most useful is: “a set of practices to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.” While not every MLOps practice is applicable at scale for every team, these best practices can elevate any size of project.\nMLOps applies the same basic principles as DevOps (development operations) in a specialized machine learning context. One common point of tension in MLOps is that data science is highly experimental and iterative compared to general purpose software delivery, but deploying to a production environment still requires reliable software engineering delivery practices. To help ease this pain point, APIs are commonly used to deploy models due to their stability and simplicity. APIs can be tested, and they act nearly identically in every architecture. This allows for software engineering practices to be applied to APIs. They have a straightforward architecture to configure and update, giving data scientists agility to retrain and update models as needed.\nTools labeled as “MLOps frameworks” have a broad scope. Tasks generally fall into one of a few different categories:\n\nOrchestration or pipelines\nExperiment tracking\nModel versioning\nModel deployment\nModel monitoring\n\nVetiver spans a few of these tasks, but is not a tool built for orchestration or experiment tracking. Rather, Vetiver focuses on the practices of versioning, deploying, and monitoring and will continue building support for these tasks."

This package brings a straightforward way to read and write objects to different locations and allows for certain data types (namely csv and arrow files) to be passed between the Python and R language fluently.\nWithin vetiver itself, the use of VetiverModel, VetiverAPI, and monitoring helper functions gives practitioners lightweight support to bring their models to many different locations via one line deployment functions (for Posit Connect) or Dockerfile generation (for numerous on-prem or public cloud locations). These objects are able to be extended to support more advanced use cases. Vetiver is able to quickly prototype REST APIs, and then scale these prototypes safely."

While the CI/CD in monitoring can be infrastructure dependent, it is important to close the loop between model prediction, monitoring, and retraining. Feedback loops are a place where bias in models can aggregate undetected. Any continuous monitoring support necessitates careful thought on how to uncover model (un)fairness.\nThe composability of vetiver with other projects, such as MLFlow or Metaflow, is needed to allow practitioners to build an MLOps framework that is flexible and meets the need of their team. Composability in this sense also includes platform agnosticism for public clouds such as Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Currently, generic Dockerfiles exist that can be hosted on these platforms, but extended documentation is needed for specific workflows."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The growing availability of big data has increased the benefits of using complex models, forcing data scientists to choose between accuracy and interpretability of a model’s output. Adding explainability methods to models that are not easily understood helps:\n\nEnsure transparency algorithmic decision-making\nIdentify potential bias in the training data\nGive a deeper understanding of the process being modeled\n\nThese methods are able to give insight into why your model generates specific outputs; explainability algorithms are especially useful in highly regulated industries (ie, pinpoint the attributes that caused someone to be denied/approved a home loan). We’ll demonstrate an anchor explainer in this notebook to better understand why a generic image detection model is creating certain outputs using the open-source library alibi.\n\nimport os\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3, decode_predictions\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array\nfrom alibi.explainers import AnchorImage\n\nTo begin, we load and format the photo into a machine readable array.\n\ndef image_pipeline(image_name):  \n\n    #Format custom picture\n    resized_image = load_img(image_name, target_size=(299, 299))\n    numpy_image = img_to_array(resized_image)\n    image_batch = np.expand_dims(numpy_image, axis=0)\n    \n    model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet')\n    preds = model.predict(image_batch)\n    \n    #Display results\n    label = decode_predictions(preds, top=3)\n    plt.title(label[0])\n    plt.imshow(resized_image)\n\n\nimage_name = 'cat.jpg'\nimage_pipeline(image_name)\n\n\n\n\nThe predict function returns the predictions via Softmax, which mean that the prediction can be translated as the probability that the image falls into one of the categories given in training. Even though we see this as a cat, the model gives a 100% probability that the image shows a pitcher. There are a few things to note here.\n\nThis is a photo I took of my own cat, so I can confidently know that the model has never seen the picture before. To a human eye, it is (hopefully) pretty obvious that the image is of a cat. However, oftentimes training data, especially images, does not accurately reflect photos that are taken by you or I. For example, the training photos may all have centered images in good lighting with nothing in the background, which is unrealistic for everyday images.\nThis is a Softmax output. The model only gives us the names of its best guesses, not how strong the prediction is. This is a subtle differentiation. The model believes that pitcher is definitely the best guess, but it could only be 1% certain in this prediction. To solve this, we could add new outcome metrics, or tweak the model.\n\nBefore we do any of that though, it could be useful for us to better understand how the model is making this prediction. We’ll use something called an explainer to dive deeper."

    "text": "The growing availability of big data has increased the benefits of using complex models, forcing data scientists to choose between accuracy and interpretability of a model’s output. Adding explainability methods to models that are not easily understood helps:\n\nEnsure transparency algorithmic decision-making\nIdentify potential bias in the training data\nGive a deeper understanding of the process being modeled\n\nThese methods are able to give insight into why your model generates specific outputs; explainability algorithms are especially useful in highly regulated industries (ie, pinpoint the attributes that caused someone to be denied/approved a home loan). We’ll demonstrate an anchor explainer in this notebook to better understand why a generic image detection model is creating certain outputs using the open-source library alibi.\n\nimport os\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3, decode_predictions\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array\nfrom alibi.explainers import AnchorImage\n\nTo begin, we load and format the photo into a machine readable array.\n\ndef image_pipeline(image_name):  \n\n    #Format custom picture\n    resized_image = load_img(image_name, target_size=(299, 299))\n    numpy_image = img_to_array(resized_image)\n    image_batch = np.expand_dims(numpy_image, axis=0)\n    \n    model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet')\n    preds = model.predict(image_batch)\n    \n    #Display results\n    label = decode_predictions(preds, top=3)\n    plt.title(label[0])\n    plt.imshow(resized_image)\n\n\nimage_name = 'cat.jpg'\nimage_pipeline(image_name)\n\n\n\n\nThe predict function returns the predictions via Softmax, which mean that the prediction can be translated as the probability that the image falls into one of the categories given in training. Even though we see this as a cat, the model gives a 100% probability that the image shows a pitcher. There are a few things to note here.\n\nThis is a photo I took of my own cat, so I can confidently know that the model has never seen the picture before. To a human eye, it is (hopefully) pretty obvious that the image is of a cat. However, oftentimes training data, especially images, does not accurately reflect photos that are taken by you or I. For example, the training photos may all have centered images in good lighting with nothing in the background, which is unrealistic for everyday images.\nThis is a Softmax output. The model only gives us the names of its best guesses, not how strong the prediction is. This is a subtle differentiation. The model believes that pitcher is definitely the best guess, but it could only be 1% certain in this prediction. To solve this, we could add new outcome metrics, or tweak the model.\n\nBefore we do any of that though, it could be useful for us to better understand how the model is making this prediction. We’ll use something called an explainer to dive deeper."

With this information in mind, data scientists may decide to go back and create a more robust exploration of the data and model. It may be the case that the training data of cats has only solid backgrounds, different lighting, different color/hair length cat, or some other feature that caused this image to not be identified correctly.\nExplainers will not fix the model itself. However, they are useful tools for data scientists to build well-architected models by exposing bias in training data and giving transparency to black-box models."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I found out about Spline from a recommended video on Instagram. It was marketed as Blender for dummies. I don’t know anything about game design. My complete knowledge of Blender was that it was good for smoothies and also animation. But, I like to think I’m a sort of creative person. I like to learn and make new things. I was certainly a dummy in this context. Why not try it out?\nI logged in (it’s freemium software), and opened up one of the templates provided. There were many instructional videos and tutorials to teach you how to use the software, but I went in headfirst and hoped for the best. If you have used Photoshop-y applications before, the layout might look vaguely reminiscient. There’s a pane on the left showing all the objects in a scene, and a pane on the right to edit a selected object. There’s buttons on top to drop you into the world, add new shapes, and easily export your scene.\nHere’s my “The Intersection” that shows a split between two ecosystems. Walk around, flip over the bench, stand on some dinosaur bones, fall off the edge into eternal darkness, there is no plot! Click on the graphic, then you can use the arrow keys to change the camera and WASD keys to move the bunny plus space bar to jump.\n\n\nSpline is not the software where Fortnite is developed. But, it doesn’t need to be. It’s a delightful tool that is easily understood, has a simple UI that doesn’t require you to know everything to be productive, and offers great templates to build from. My goal was never to change career paths into game design; my goal was to make something that isn’t too embarrassingly bad to put in a blog post and have some fun along the way.\nAnyway, like most software, Spline is a good example of the fact that sometimes you don’t need the best tool for the job, you need the best tool for you."

    "text": "Starting out\nIf you’re wanting to invest a books-length amount of time into learning about MLOps, Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen is my number one recommendation. This book has information for the whole machine learning lifecycle from building a model to building a system for that model to live in. If you’re mostly interested in the MLOps parts, I recommend starting with chapters 2, 7, 8, 9, and 11.\nMLOps Principles is a culmination of a lot of the most-cited MLOps literature, so if you’re wanting a starting point with lots of side quest opportunities, this is a good place to start. I particularly liked the idea of “Continuous X”; this extends the idea of CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) to include Continuous Training and Continuous Delivery. It highlights out an important piece of MLOps: it’s never finished.\nIf you’re interested in learning what “real” MLOps people do, “Operationalizing Machine Learning: An Interview Study” by Shreya Shankar et al is the article to read. This piece feels foundational to me. There is important discussion about the fundamental differences between building models and building traditional software, why not every model gets deployed, and much much more. It’s a digestable paper, and I highly recommend reading this one all the way through.\nAnd, I can’t write this without giving a personal plug: I’ve given a number of MLOps talks, which you can view at the “Talks” tab on this page! A good “starting point” talk of mine is Demystifying MLOps, which I presented at rstudio::conf(2022)."

If you’re interested in the pain points of How ML Breaks: A Decade of Outages for One Large ML Pipeline by Papasian and Underwood. This video walks through all the ways the ML pipeline at Google has broken; breakages are categorized in numerous ways, but one particularly interesting one is ML failures/Non-ML failures. Spoiler alert: most failures were not machine learning failures.\nWith a model in production, you’ll want to monitor it. Reliable Maintenance of Machine Learning Models by Julia Silge is a great overview of why you should be monitoring models. This talk outlines what “performing well” means to different stakeholders of model systems and explains the multiple types of drift that can happen once your model is out in the wild.\nIf you have implemented MLOps practices, “The ML Test Score: A Rubric for ML Production Readiness and Technical Debt Reduction” by E.Breck et al. 2017 is a must read. It shows and rates a practical progression of machine learning systems, which is often not adding versioning systems -&gt; adding model deployment -&gt; starting to monitor models; rather, it usually follows the pattern of systems are not implemented -&gt; systems are implemented manually -&gt; systems are run automatically.\nEvent streaming won’t be a required skill for all people who are using MLOps practices. However, if you want to learn about it, Gently Down the Stream by Mitch Seymour is a children’s book which also happens to be the best explanation of Kafka I have ever read. Plus it is an adorable, digestible, maybe 5-minute read.\nFinally– if you’ve devoured this list and are still hungry for more, MLOps guide by Chip Huyen is a secondary curated list of MLOps content that I have gone through and absolutely adore."

    "text": "As someone who identifies as a Chicago Bears fan for life, I have some strong superstitions rituals on gameday. In a completely hypothetical example, I might have one model that I feel must be used when the Bears have a home game, and a different model for any other day. (They always win when I use this model to write blog posts on game days, and I fear a replay of the 2016 season when our win-loss ratio was 3-13 if I change my ways.)\nOftentimes you need to deploy more than one model. Even if the fate of your favorite NFL team isn’t depending upon your models’ locations, it’s important to understand where these models should be living. tldr;\n\nInput data is the same -&gt; use one API\nInput data is not the same -&gt; use multiple APIs\n\n(These are not definitive rules. A lot of this is dependent upon architecture, how your deployment is set up, what works best for your organization, etc. Also, vetiver allows you to break both of these rules!)\nIf your models are unrelated and the input data is different, you probably want to put them on different APIs. However, if the input data is the same for multiple different models, it might make sense to deploy them on the same API, but at different endpoints.\nFor our Chicago train ridership data, we ALWAYS want to predict ridership from the same parameters every time. However, if the data indicates it was a home game for the Chicago Bears, we want to use our lucky model.\nLet’s start by loading some data and use tidymodels to put all our preprocessing in one recipe.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\ndata(Chicago)\n\nchicago_small &lt;- Chicago %&gt;% slice(1:730) # two years of data\n\nchicago_rec &lt;-\n  recipe(ridership ~ ., data = Chicago) %&gt;%\n  step_date(date) %&gt;%\n  step_holiday(date, keep_original_cols = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %&gt;%\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) %&gt;%\n  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %&gt;%\n  step_pca(all_of(stations), num_comp = 4)\n\nWe can then use tidymodels to make multiple different models quickly. Notice that I am actually putting my preprocessing recipe in the recipe with my model. This is intentional, and best practice for modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFeature engineering is part of your model workflow. You should be packaging this up with your model and deploying it as part of your model workflow. In Python, this involves using something like scikit learn Pipelines. In R, this involves using something like tidymodels workflows.\n\n\n\nBuild a few models for home games (support vectors for extra support at home):\n\ntree_model &lt;-\n  svm_linear() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"LiblineaR\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"regression\")\n\nhome_game_model &lt;-\n  workflow(chicago_rec, tree_model) %&gt;%\n  fit(chicago_small)\n\nAnd not home games:\n\nlinear_model &lt;-\n  linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\nnot_home_game_model &lt;-\n  workflow(chicago_rec, tree_model) %&gt;% \n  fit(chicago_small)\n\nNext, I will make some deployable model objects, or vetiver_model, with the vetiver package.\n\nlibrary(vetiver)\n\nhome &lt;- vetiver_model(home_game_model, \"home\")\nnot_home &lt;- vetiver_model(not_home_game_model, \"not_home\")\n\nNormally we would be iterating through models and possibly versioning them as well, but let’s skip that step and go right to deployment.\nI’ll deploy these two models on ONE plumber API by using a combination of vetiver_pr_post() and vetiver_pr_docs() along with the path argument.\n\nlibrary(plumber)\n\npr() %&gt;% \n  vetiver_pr_post(home, path = \"/home_game\") %&gt;% \n  vetiver_pr_docs(home) %&gt;% \n  vetiver_pr_post(not_home, path = \"/not_home_game\") %&gt;% \n  vetiver_pr_docs(not_home) %&gt;% \n  pr_run()\n\nNow, to make predictions, I will route data to each endpoint respectively. To do this on your own computer, you will have to run the above commands as background job (or deploy it with docker.)\nWe can make predictions at each endpoint with data. Of course this can be as complex or simple as you desire, but here’s the meat-and-potatoes of it.\n\nhome_endpoint &lt;- vetiver_endpoint('http://127.0.0.1:5331/home_game')\n\nhome_data &lt;- Chicago %&gt;%\n  filter(Bears_Home == 1) %&gt;%\n  tail(5)\n\npredict(home_endpoint, home_data)\n\n\nnot_home_endpoint &lt;- vetiver_endpoint('http://127.0.0.1:5331/not_home_game')\n\nnot_home_data &lt;- Chicago %&gt;%\n  filter(Bears_Home == 0) %&gt;%\n  tail(5)\n\npredict(not_home_endpoint, not_home_data)\n\nWe have now created an API with multiple models at various endpoints, and successfully interacted with them! This is a great start to making more complex MLOps workflows with vetiver."

My favorite tools right now are pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv, which keep me mostly out of trouble, but there is some extra legwork to get them set up with RStudio IDE.\nI usually start by checking what Python is being used by going to the RStudio console and running:\nreticulate::py_config()\nThis gives me:\npython:         /usr/bin/python3\nlibpython:      /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/config-3.8-darwin/libpython3.8.dylib\npythonhome:     /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8\nversion:        3.8.9 (default, Aug  3 2021, 19:21:54)  [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.3)]\nnumpy:           [NOT FOUND]\nwhich is nice, since at least some sort of Python is THERE, but I want to follow the Golden Rule: don’t touch the system Python.\nTime to do some environment gymnastics. My first move is to allow pyenv to share its environment, which is required to use envs with reticulate.\nenv PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=\"--enable-shared\" pyenv install 3.9.4\npyenv virtualenv 3.9.4 newenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you skip this step, you will get an error similar to:\nError: '/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.11/envs/pydemo/bin/python' was not \nbuilt with a shared library. reticulate can only bind to copies of Python \nbuilt with '--enable-shared'.\n\n\nNext, we’re going to restart the R session, and try to just add this new Python environment in there. The key here is RESTART R SESSION (on macOS, this is commmand+shift+0) and then DON’T TRY TO RUN ANYTHING IN PYTHON BEFORE THESE NEXT FEW COMMANDS. If you “just try to run one thing to see if {insert ridiculous Python MultiEnvironmentVerse of Madness strategy} worked,” you will end up in an endless loop of setting environment variables that are ignored since they are already initialized (this sentence is hard-won for me). Let’s try to use reticulate to set Python first.\nreticulate::use_python('/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/bin/python', required = TRUE)\ngives us:\nWarning message:\nThe request to `use_python(\"/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.11/envs/newenv/bin/python\")` \nwill be ignored because the environment variable RETICULATE_PYTHON is set to \"/usr/bin/python3\" \nThis is a helpful warning that tells us we need to set up the RETICULATE_PYTHON environment variable. We can do this by:\nSys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON='/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/bin/python')\nand then check to see if it worked since we have pretty strong trust issues.\nSys.getenv(\"RETICULATE_PYTHON\")\n[1] \"/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/bin/python\"\nPromising! Let’s check out the reticulate::py_config() now.\nreticulate::py_config()\npython:         /Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/bin/python\nlibpython:      /Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/lib/libpython3.9.dylib\npythonhome:     /Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv:/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv\nversion:        3.9.4 (default, May 31 2022, 09:32:34)  [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.3)]\nnumpy:          /Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy\nnumpy_version:  1.23.1\n\nNOTE: Python version was forced by RETICULATE_PYTHON\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf this doesn’t work, I would tell you to go digging for your RETICULATE_PYTHON environment variable. Some places to check out:\nvi ~/.Renviron\nshould open a file that has environment variables, specifically our elusive RETICULATE_PYTHON. We can update that file to look like:\nexport RETICULATE_PYTHON=/Users/isabelzimmerman/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/envs/newenv/bin/python\n\n\nIT WORKED! Time to run all the Python I can. I’m fully open to better workflows if you have them, but for now, this gets me on my way when I feel the despair of another broken Python environment.\nAlso, S/O to Firas Sadiyah’s blog post on pyenv + RStudio which has helped me many a time to get on the right track!"

    "text": "My partner, Val, has been asking to making a fancy Quarto blog. Today, we’re going through this step-by-step together. There’s a few different ways to do this, and the RStudio IDE has UI to make this a pretty slick process. However, I don’t spend much time in RStudio, so here’s my IDE agnostic workflow. You’ll need:\n\nA GitHub account\nTo install Quarto here if you haven’t yet\nAccess to the command line (eg, “Terminal” on a Mac)\n\n\nStep 1: Make the repository\nGo to github.com and click on your profile image in the top right corner. In the dropdown, click on Your repositories and then click New to create a new repository.\n\nCreate a new repository in GitHub and name it your-github-username.github.io. This is a secret repository structure in GitHub to host a blog for your account! Next, open up the terminal and use the cd command to navigate to the folder you would like to store your blog in. Use the command git clone {repository-url} to copy the repository onto your computer, and cd your-github-username.github.io into your local version.\n\n\nStep 2: Create blog\nIn the folder for your repository, type quarto create project blog . into your CLI tool and press enter. Congratulations, you have built a blog! Use quarto preview to build and view it locally.\n\n\nStep 3: Update the blog\nThere’s a few places you will want to update before you publish your blog for the world to see. First, open up the file called index.qmd and add some information about yourself. I have a few sentences of introduction, my education, and how to get in contact with me. Next, open up the folder called posts/ and update it to remove the default posts. If you’d like to write a blog post of your own, the easiest way to organize the posts is by making each one into its own folder. Then, each folder can contain a .qmd, .md, .Rmd, or .ipynb file as a post and any relevant images.\nFor simple aesthetics, you can go to the _quarto.yml file and try out different bootstrap themes, or add some color to your navbar by adding a background field to your navbar\nwebsite:\n  title: \"my blog\"\n  description: \"my personal blog\"\n  navbar:\n    background: \"#ffccff\" # accepts color names like red, blue, or hex codes\n\n\nStep 4: Push to Github Pages\nWhile still in the folder of your blog, run quarto publish gh-pages. You will be prompted with some text like: Publish site to your-github-username.github.io? Accept this, and let it run.\n\n\nStep 5: Set the deployment branch to gh-pages\nBack to GitHub, view your repository. Go to the settings for the repo, and click on Pages. Then, change the Build and deploy from source to the gh-pages branch.\n\nIf you go back to the main page of your repository, you will see a tab Deployments underneath the repository description. The green checkmark means your blog has been successfully deployed! The url will be something like your-github-username.github.io\nGoing forward, each time you want to update your website, you can reuse the quarto publish gh-pages command."

The audience was great, and there were lots of questions about the tricks I taught my dog (which, much like my models, performed well in my living room but not so well in the real world), but also about MLOps and vetiver. This talk is good to listen to if you’d like to learn more about:\n\nthe tension MLOps creates between software engineering and data science workflows\nwhen and where you can version models with pins\nwhy your DevOps friends might be confused when you say you’re monitoring a model\nhow to write good models (from a fairness perspective)"
